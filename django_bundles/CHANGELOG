Version 0.4.1
=============

 - Added --dev option to create_bundles to set the hash version for each file to "_" (for easy overwriting and removal)
 - Added DEVELOPMENT_BUNDLES setting - a list of bundles to render as separate tags when USE_BUNDLES=True (useful when developing and only making changes to one or two bundles)
